## Overview
> Books are life-changing. They have the power to enlighten, educate, entertain, heal, and help us grow. Build out this code base to create an web app to track what books have impacted you, and what's recommended to read next.

## Getting Started
<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log
<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

>
> - Make a list of each person’s strengths. Tyler - backend, Mel - frontend.
> - How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application? By maximizing collaboration at all times. 
> - In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength? Tyler - frontend, Mel - backend. 
> - Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development? By maximizing collaboration at all times.

> ### Conflict Resolution
>
> - What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing? Switch driver/navigator
> - What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute? > Switch driver/navigator
